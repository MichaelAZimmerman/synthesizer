        This app is for having fun with synthesizer effects and settings using
        Tone.js. It currently struggles with the Safari browser and smart phone
        browsers. The keyboard allows you to try different wave shapes with some
        effects. The Sequencer allows you to program drums and melody with 16
        steps. The location drone feature searches for cities world-wide and
        generates a 3-oscillator drone based upon the current weather in that
        location.
